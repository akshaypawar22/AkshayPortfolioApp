                                            <p>I am a MCA student from Sardar Patel Institute of Technology with 8.43 CGPA. I love exploring new technologies and often amazed by the progress we as a human species have mad so far in the recent years (apart from the headphone-jack part!!)</p>
                                            <p>I come to the industry with my skills in programming and wish to learn how to utilize these alongside my soft skills. I define myself as a Commited, hardworking and problem solving personality. I am a team player and very optimistic in tough times. I believe learning never stops and I aim to only grow and upskill myself in the future. I spend at least 2 Hrs a day on my personal learning.
                                                My aim is to be a part of an organization where I can enhance my knowledge and training towards organizational growth and I am willing to learn in making the organization successful.
                                                I was very fortunate to be part of SPIT and do some IT projects.
